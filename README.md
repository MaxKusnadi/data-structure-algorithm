# Python Data Structure and Algorithm
A collection of data structure and implementations in python

# Contribution Guide
1. Fork this repo.
2. Raise a pull request
3. Make sure you have done unit testing for each file and aim for 100% coverage

# Implementation Guide
1. Go to the desired folder (data structures or algorithm)
2. Create a file in CamelCase format
3. Code
4. Format your code following PEP8 standard. If you're using SublimeText, you can use `PEP8 AutoFormat`
5. Create your unit tests in `test_cases/DataStructire/your_file.py` or `test_cases/Algorithm/your_file.py`
6. Import your test cases to `test.py`
7. Run `python test.py`

# Getting Coverage
1. Install `coverage` by using `pip` i.e. `pip install coverage`
2. Run this `coverage run --source=DataStructure,Algorithm -m unittest`
3. See the report by typing `coverage report -m`
4. Try to hit 100% coverage
